* What is it

This repo provides the configuration for a NixOS UTM VM on macOS.

* Why this?

I wonder this question too.

* Requirements for the VM

** Must have

- VM Type :: Must use apple Virtualization, not ~QEMU~
- Network :: This *netowrk* type of the VM must be *shared*, instead of *bridged*.
- Share :: The host machine must share the host user's home folder with ~virtiofs~ type.
  (Still not sure how to solve the UID/GID problem with the mounted filesystem)
- SSH Key :: The ssh keys, including public and private keys, must under the .ssh directory of the home folder.
  (Provided that the ~share~ Requirement met as above)

** Nicd to have

The *display* can be removed so that you can use the command line
tool *utmctl* to start/stop the VM.
