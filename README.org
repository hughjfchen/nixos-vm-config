* What is it

This repo provides the configuration for a NixOS UTM VM on macOS.

* Why this?

I wonder this question too.

* Requirements for the VM

** Must have

This *netowrk* type of the VM must be *shared*, instead of *bridged*.

** Nicd to have

The *display* can be removed so that you can use the command line
tool *utmctl* to start/stop the VM.
